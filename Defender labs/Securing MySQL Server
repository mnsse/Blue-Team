Defender Labs : Securing MySQLServer

##The Lab Details##

In this lab environment, we will access a Kali GUI instance. Also, GUI access to the Linux server is provided to us. It can be accessed using the tools installed on Kali at http://readacted.local. we have Windows machine running a misconfigured MySQL service that can be used for malicious activity.
Our task is to find all the possible misconfiguration and sensitive information and fix it by making changes on the target machine, then check the behavior on the attacker machine (Kali).

#Objective## :

Find the sensitive information and misconfigurations on the target machine, which runs the MySQL server, and then fix the issues

The task that we need to perform to secure the MySQL server:

1-The target machine has an arbitrary file read vulnerability.
2-No password for the root users
3-Password complexity policy not enabled/applied
4-Remove Default Accounts
5-Drop the Test Database
6-Disable remote login of the sensitive users i.e. root, admin, etc
7-Default Port Mappings
